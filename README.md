# library-typescript-boilerplate

Simple put a boilerplate node.js module using TypeScript and the latest preferred configuration.

Clarification: Latest is the latest I know about, and preferred is my preferred way. You might prefer something else.
You might convince me via PR that you way is better.  Or you might not :-)
